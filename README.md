Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python that makes it easy to build web applications quickly. Itâ€™s simple to get started with and provides the essential tools to create web apps, APIs, and more.

## Key Features
- **Minimal and Simple:** Focuses on simplicity with minimal boilerplate.
- **Flexible:** Add only the components you need.
- **Built-in Development Server:** Test your app locally.
- **Routing:** Map URLs to Python functions easily.
- **Jinja2 Templating:** Render dynamic HTML.
- **Extension Support:** Integrate features like authentication and database access.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Flask
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install Flask
```

### 2. Create a Simple App
Create a file called `app.py` and add the following code:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### 3. Run the App
In your terminal, run:
```bash
python app.py
```
You should see output indicating the app is running.

### 4. Access Your App
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
You should see "Hello, Flask!" displayed.

## Why Use Flask?
- Ideal for small to medium projects.
- Provides control without unnecessary complexity.
- Great for prototyping and learning web development with Python.

## Next Steps
- Explore routing, templates, and forms.
- Integrate with databases.
- Deploy your app to the cloud.
